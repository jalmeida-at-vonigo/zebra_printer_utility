# Documentation & Cursor Rule Organization and Completion Requirements

## 1. Documentation Hierarchy & Navigability
- All documentation must be organized for easy navigation and clarity.
- Top-level docs must include:
  - [README.md](mdc:README.md): Project overview, quickstart, and links to deeper docs.
  - [docs/architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md): System/component diagrams, high-level flows.
  - [docs/usage.md](mdc:docs/usage.md): Public API usage, code samples, and workflows.
  - [docs/error-codes.md](mdc:docs/error-codes.md): All error codes/messages, with explanations and usage.
  - [docs/development.md](mdc:docs/development.md): Contribution, code style, and internal architecture.
  - [docs/platforms/ios.md](mdc:docs/platforms/ios.md), [docs/platforms/android.md](mdc:docs/platforms/android.md): Platform-specific integration notes.
  - [docs/examples.md](mdc:docs/examples.md): Example app structure and maintenance.
- Each doc must start with a "Contents" section for navigation.
- All docs must cross-link to relevant files and rules using `[filename](mdc:filename)` format.

## 2. Cursor Rule Structure
- General rules: `.cursor/rules/general.mdc`
- Dart/Flutter code style: `.cursor/rules/dart.mdc`
- Command pattern: `.cursor/rules/command-pattern.mdc`
- Error code architecture: `.cursor/rules/error-code-architecture.mdc`
- Example maintenance: `.cursor/rules/example-maintenance.mdc`
- Platform-specific: `.cursor/rules/ios/`, `.cursor/rules/android/`
- Event system: `.cursor/rules/event-system.mdc`
- Zebra printer architecture: `.cursor/rules/zebra-printer-architecture.mdc`
- Each rule must have a "Last updated" section at the top.
- Rules must be consolidated for clarity, or split if a topic grows too large or covers multiple concerns.
- All rules must be reviewed and updated after any relevant discussion or codebase change.

## 3. Completion Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Every public API, error, and workflow must be documented.**
- **All error codes/messages must be in a single source of truth ([result.dart](mdc:lib/models/result.dart) and [docs/error-codes.md](mdc:docs/error-codes.md)).**
- **All platform-specific quirks must be in their respective docs.**
- **All Cursor rules must be updated after any significant discussion, refactor, or feature addition.**
- **Each rule and doc must be reviewed for clarity, coverage, and navigability after every major change.**
- **No ambiguous, outdated, or duplicate documentation or rules are allowed.**
- **All rules and docs must be cross-linked for discoverability.**

## 4. Update Discipline
- After any significant change, update all relevant documentation and Cursor rules immediately.
- Add a "Last updated" section to every rule and doc.
- If a rule is split, both parent and child rules must cross-link.
- Regularly review and refactor documentation and rules for clarity and completeness.
