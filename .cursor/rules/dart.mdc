# Dart/Flutter Code Standards

- Follow Flutter plugin best practices for all Dart code.
- Complexity should be handled on the Dart/Flutter side as much as possible; keep native code thin.
- Use proper error handling with PlatformException.
- Maintain consistent API across platforms.
- Use proper queue management for async operations.
- Handle optionals safely.
- Provide meaningful error messages.
- All code must be null safe and use the latest Dart language features.
- All public APIs must be documented with Dartdoc comments.
