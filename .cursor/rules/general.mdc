# COMPLETION

* The code is clean and working.
    - There is no LINT errors or WARNINGS, therefore no LINT ERRORS OR WARNINGS ARE ACCEPTABLE
    - No ANALYSIS WARNING ARE ACCEPTABLE (`flutter analyze`)
* Only the dart code and the iOS need to be evaluated/changed.
    - We are not supporting Android yet, therefore nothing needs to be evaluated or changed for it.
* The change must be documented as detailed on the DOCUMENTATION section below
* Update the version number:
    - Only use patch increments ALWAYS
* Update the @CHANGELOG.md with the changes
    - There is no need to document migration, breaking changes, or unreleased, as nothing was released yet.
* There is no duplicate exports on [zebrautil.dart](mdc:lib/zebrautil.dart)
* All the tests were updated and are passing with the proper implementation.
* There should be no TODO, either by comment or by knowing, at the end of the task. If you are not able to complete, ask for help.

# ZEBRAUTIL

* The services and models are exporting using [zebrautil.dart](mdc:lib/zebrautil.dart)](mdc:lib/zebrautil.dart).
* Hide duplicate exports while reexporting the classes.

# DOCUMENTATION

* ALWAYS update [README.md](mdc:README.md) and the `.readme` folder to keep the docs in sync with relevant details
* The docs are about:
    - Usability of the API
    - Standards about the development and architecture, and
* There is no need to write any MIGRATION GUIDE or MIGRATION STEPS anywhere as there was nothing released yet.
