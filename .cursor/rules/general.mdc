- ALWAYS update [README.md](mdc:README.md) and the `.readme` folder to keep the docs in sync with relevante details
- The docs are about:

- Update the [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:.readme/development/CHANGELOG.md) with the changes, but there is no need to document migration, breaking changes, or unreleased, as nothing was released yet.
