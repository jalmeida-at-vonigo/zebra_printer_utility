# Callback-Based Operations Framework Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Refactor all native method calls in the Zebra Printer plugin to use a unified callback-based operations framework that tracks completion of each operation through native callbacks, eliminating the need for artificial delays.

## Goals
1. **Real Completion Tracking**: Every operation completes based on actual native callbacks, not arbitrary delays
2. **Operation ID Tracking**: Each operation has a unique ID that links the native callback to the specific caller
3. **Unified Framework**: Extract operations framework into reusable internal classes
4. **Timeout Protection**: All operations have generous but defined timeouts
5. **No Manual Delays**: Remove all `Future.delayed()` calls in favor of callback-based completion

## Current State Analysis

### Operations Currently Using Callbacks
- `print` → `onPrintComplete` / `onPrintError` (partially implemented, needs operation ID)
- `startScan` → `onDiscoveryDone` (exists but no operation ID)
- Discovery events → `printerFound`, `printerRemoved` (event-based, not operation-based)
- Status updates → `changePrinterStatus` (event-based)

### Operations Needing Callback Implementation
1. **Connection Operations**
   - `connectToPrinter` → needs `onConnectComplete` / `onConnectError`
   - `connectToGenericPrinter` → needs `onConnectComplete` / `onConnectError`
   - `disconnect` → needs `onDisconnectComplete` / `onDisconnectError`
   
2. **Discovery Operations**
   - `checkPermission` → needs `onPermissionResult`
   - `stopScan` → needs `onStopScanComplete`
   
3. **Settings Operations**
   - `setSettings` → needs `onSettingsComplete` / `onSettingsError`
   - `getLocateValue` → needs result callback (currently synchronous)
   
4. **Status Operations**
   - `isPrinterConnected` → currently synchronous, needs callback for consistency

### Artificial Delays to Remove
- **Connection delays**: 300-500ms after connect operations
- **Print delays**: 500ms-2s after print operations  
- **Settings delays**: 500ms after mode changes
- **Retry delays**: 1-2s between retry attempts (these may need to stay)
- **Auto-correction delays**: 100-500ms (some may be necessary for hardware)

## Architecture Design

### Dart Side Structure
```
lib/
├── internal/
│   ├── operation_manager.dart        # Core operation tracking
│   ├── operation_callback_handler.dart # Callback routing
│   └── native_operation.dart         # Operation definition
└── zebra_printer.dart               # Updated to use operation manager
```

### Architecture Decision: Remove ZebraOperationQueue Entirely
With proper callback-based completion tracking, we don't need a queue! The natural async/await flow provides sequencing automatically.

**Example:**
```dart
// This naturally sequences operations without a queue:
await connect();      // Waits for onConnectComplete callback
await print(data);    // Waits for onPrintComplete callback  
await disconnect();   // Waits for onDisconnectComplete callback
```

### Native Side Structure (iOS)
```
ios/Classes/
├── Internal/
│   ├── OperationManager.swift       # Operation tracking
│   ├── CallbackHandler.swift        # Callback management
│   └── Operation.swift              # Operation definition
└── ZebraPrinterInstance.swift       # Updated to use operation manager
```

## Example Implementation

### Dart Side - Operation Manager
```dart
// lib/internal/operation_manager.dart
class OperationManager {
  final MethodChannel _channel;
  final Map<String, NativeOperation> _activeOperations = {};
  
  Future<T> execute<T>({
    required String method,
    Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
    Duration timeout = const Duration(seconds: 30),
  }) async {
    final operationId = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch.toString();
    final operation = NativeOperation(
      id: operationId,
      method: method,
      arguments: arguments ?? {},
      timeout: timeout,
    );
    
    _activeOperations[operationId] = operation;
    
    try {
      // Add operation ID to arguments
      final args = Map<String, dynamic>.from(arguments ?? {});
      args['operationId'] = operationId;
      
      // Start the native operation
      await _channel.invokeMethod(method, args);
      
      // Wait for completion with timeout
      return await operation.completer.future.timeout(
        timeout,
        onTimeout: () {
          _activeOperations.remove(operationId);
          throw TimeoutException('Operation $method timed out');
        },
      );
    } finally {
      _activeOperations.remove(operationId);
    }
  }
}
```

### iOS Side - Callback Implementation
```swift
// Connection operation with callback
private func connectToPrinter(address: String, operationId: String, result: @escaping FlutterResult) {
    connectionQueue.async { [weak self] in
        guard let self = self else { return }
        
        let isBluetoothDevice = !address.contains(".")
        let connection = ZSDKWrapper.connect(toPrinter: address, isBluetoothConnection: isBluetoothDevice)
        
        if connection != nil {
            self.connection = connection
            
            // Send success callback with operation ID
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.channel.invokeMethod("onConnectComplete", arguments: [
                    "operationId": operationId
                ])
                result(nil)
            }
        } else {
            // Send error callback with operation ID
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.channel.invokeMethod("onConnectError", arguments: [
                    "operationId": operationId,
                    "error": "Failed to connect to printer"
                ])
                result(FlutterError(code: "CONNECTION_ERROR", 
                                  message: "Failed to connect to printer", 
                                  details: nil))
            }
        }
    }
}
```
