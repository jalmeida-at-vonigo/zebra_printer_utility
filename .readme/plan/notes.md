Do I still need ZebraOperationQueue?

/Generate Cursor Rules for the operation based impl for the native calls + callback


The Result architecture onnly cover errors constants. Make it support successful constants as well. It is ok for them to be separated constants lists (errors and successful). Review the formatArgs usage to replace variables (like just the attempt number, and not all message with the attempt in it). Update ethe cursor rules

Update the smart printing to do pooling and emulate realtime status update for the statuses of the printing. Be sure to use multi-channel for WiFi and the proper way (or not use if not possible) for the BT. For the WiFi multi-channel make sure that all network printers support it, and code it in a way that only the supported printers will have.

Implement a nice animation the status move link a fluid ink to start to have a progress indicator on the next step on transitions between Connecting Printing Done

Once done, fill in the done status on the progress indicator, and then animate the small done indicator becoming the bing green done of the last step.


We have an issue with a black screen sliding from the right to the left after closing the popup, and are now

Review and simplify all the animations code paths, even if it means removing some. Be agressive on the animation removal, as we do have a few issues to be fixed, that makes the application to be overlayed by a black screen on popup closeing. Maybe we do have a later animation (back/forward) that gets called after popup closing, therefore acts on the main screen.


# Conflict resolution
-------------------


The codebase had a common start point on 6a5dd74193b52e967d5cefb82261159973c639b0, but then it started to differentiate on e0e7f4e54be2da244821abc9e756d994f9bbde74 all all changes were reintegrated after fixing and refactorings

Proceed with the merging conflict resolution with this in mind, focusing on bring new resources to the current codebase

DO NOT COMMIT AT THE END, as I will do it myself after my review.

Rewrite readiness with https://techdocs.zebra.com/link-os/2-13/ios/content/interface_printer_status

Several commands and points does something similar to:

ErrorCode _classifyConnectionError(String errorMessage) {
    final message = errorMessage.toLowerCase();

    if (message.contains('timeout')) {
      return ErrorCodes.connectionTimeout;
    } else if (message.contains('permission') || message.contains('denied')) {
      return ErrorCodes.noPermission;
    } else if (message.contains('bluetooth') && message.contains('disabled')) {
      return ErrorCodes.bluetoothDisabled;
    } else if (message.contains('network') || message.contains('wifi')) {
      return ErrorCodes.networkError;
    } else if (message.contains('not found') ||
        message.contains('unavailable')) {
      return ErrorCodes.invalidDeviceAddress;
    } else {
      return ErrorCodes.connectionError;
    }
  }


      // Classify the error for better recovery
      if (e.toString().contains('timeout')) {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.statusTimeoutError,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      } else if (e.toString().contains('connection') ||
          e.toString().contains('disconnect')) {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.statusConnectionError,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      } else {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.basicStatusCheckFailed,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      }

            // Classify the error for better recovery
      if (e.toString().contains('timeout')) {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.statusTimeoutError,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      } else if (e.toString().contains('connection') ||
          e.toString().contains('disconnect')) {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.statusConnectionError,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      } else {
        return Result.errorCode(
          ErrorCodes.detailedStatusCheckFailed,
          formatArgs: [e.toString()],
        );
      }
  Analyze all of those places and DRY it out.
