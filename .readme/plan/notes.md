Do I still need ZebraOperationQueue?

/Generate Cursor Rules for the operation based impl for the native calls + callback


The Result architecture onnly cover errors constants. Make it support successful constants as well. It is ok for them to be separated constants lists (errors and successful). Review the formatArgs usage to replace variables (like just the attempt number, and not all message with the attempt in it). Update ethe cursor rules

Update the smart printing to do pooling and emulate realtime status update for the statuses of the printing. Be sure to use multi-channel for WiFi and the proper way (or not use if not possible) for the BT. For the WiFi multi-channel make sure that all network printers support it, and code it in a way that only the supported printers will have.


Confliect resolution


The codebase had a common start point on 6a5dd74193b52e967d5cefb82261159973c639b0, but then it started to differentiate on e0e7f4e54be2da244821abc9e756d994f9bbde74 all all changes were reintegrated after fixing and refactorings

Proceed with the merging conflict resolution with this in mind, focusing on bring new resources to the current codebase

DO NOT COMMIT AT THE END, as I will do it myself after my review.
