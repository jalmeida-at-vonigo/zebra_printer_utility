Do I still need ZebraOperationQueue?

/Generate Cursor Rules for the operation based impl for the native calls + callback


The Result architecture onnly cover errors constants. Make it support successful constants as well. It is ok for them to be separated constants lists (errors and successful). Review the formatArgs usage to replace variables (like just the attempt number, and not all message with the attempt in it). Update ethe cursor rules

Update the smart printing to do pooling and emulate realtime status update for the statuses of the printing. Be sure to use multi-channel for WiFi and the proper way (or not use if not possible) for the BT. For the WiFi multi-channel make sure that all network printers support it, and code it in a way that only the supported printers will have.

Implement a nice animation the status move link a fluid ink to start to have a progress indicator on the next step on transitions between Connecting Printing Done

Once done, fill in the done status on the progress indicator, and then animate the small done indicator becoming the bing green done of the last step.
