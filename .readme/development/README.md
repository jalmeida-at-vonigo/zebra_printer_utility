# Development Documentation

This section contains documentation for developers working on the Zebra Printer Utility plugin.

## Development Resources

### üìã [Future Improvements](TODO.md)
Comprehensive roadmap and planned features for the plugin, including architectural improvements and code sharing strategies.

### üìù [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
Complete history of changes, bug fixes, and new features across all versions of the plugin.

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture
- **Native Code**: Keep minimal, focus on platform-specific bridging
- **Dart Logic**: Move business logic to Dart for better code sharing
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error patterns across platforms
- **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage

### Code Organization
- **iOS**: Use Objective-C wrapper for ZSDK, Swift for business logic
- **Android**: Keep ZSDK integration minimal, focus on bridging
- **Dart**: Centralize printer operations, discovery, and connection management
