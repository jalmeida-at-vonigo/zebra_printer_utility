# Zebra Printer Plugin Architecture Improvements

## Completed Tasks

### 1. iOS Bi-directional Communication
- Added `getSetting` method to read SGD responses from printer
- Added `sendDataWithResponse` method for generic command/response communication
- Implemented proper response reading with timeouts in ZSDKWrapper
- Updated ZebraPrinterService to use real SGD responses for printer status checks

### 2. AutoPrint Improvements
- Modified autoPrint to only work with paired Bluetooth printers
- Added logic to find and use a single paired printer automatically
- Fails gracefully if no paired printers or multiple paired printers found
- Provides clear error messages to guide user actions

### 3. Operation Queue Improvements
- Made operation processing truly async with proper await/async
- Improved error handling and timeout management
- Better integration with the service layer

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Android Bi-directional Communication
- Add getSetting method to Android Printer.java
- Add sendDataWithResponse method to Android
- Implement proper response reading on Android side
- Test with real Android devices

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery
- Implement automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Add retry logic for individual SGD commands
- Better error categorization (recoverable vs non-recoverable)

### 3. Printer Status Monitoring
- Add continuous status monitoring capability
- Implement status change notifications
- Add printer event stream (paper out, head open, etc.)

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Cache printer capabilities after first query
- Batch SGD commands when possible
- Optimize discovery for known printers

## Architecture Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Paired Printers Only for AutoPrint**: This ensures predictable behavior and prevents accidental printing to wrong devices
2. **Bi-directional Communication**: Essential for proper status checking and command verification
3. **Operation Queue**: Ensures sequential execution and prevents command overlap

### SGD Commands Used for Status
- `media.status` - Check if media/paper is ready
- `head.latch` - Check if print head is closed
- `device.pause` - Check if printer is paused
- `device.host_status` - Overall printer status

### Future Enhancements
1. Support for printer profiles (save settings per printer)
2. Advanced print job management (queue, cancel, status)
3. Support for printer firmware updates
4. Enhanced security features (encrypted communication)
