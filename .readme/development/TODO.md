# TODO: Future Improvements for Zebra Printer Plugin

## High Priority

### 1. Reorganize Native Code Architecture
**Goal**: Move business logic to Dart, keep native code minimal for better code sharing

#### iOS Refactoring
- [ ] **Minimize ZSDKWrapper.m** - Keep only essential ZSDK bridging methods
- [ ] **Move printer language detection to Dart** - Implement format detection in Dart layer
- [ ] **Centralize connection management** - Handle connection state in Dart
- [ ] **Move discovery logic to Dart** - Coordinate discovery from Dart, native only handles raw discovery
- [ ] **Simplify ZebraPrinterInstance.swift** - Remove business logic, keep only method channel handling

#### Android Refactoring  
- [ ] **Minimize Printer.java** - Keep only essential ZSDK bridging methods
- [ ] **Move printer language detection to Dart** - Same format detection logic as iOS
- [ ] **Centralize connection management** - Handle connection state in Dart
- [ ] **Move discovery logic to Dart** - Coordinate discovery from Dart, native only handles raw discovery

#### Shared Dart Logic
- [ ] **Create shared printer language detection** - Detect ZPL vs CPCL vs raw text
- [ ] **Implement connection state management** - Track connection status, handle reconnections
- [ ] **Create unified discovery coordinator** - Manage discovery across platforms
- [ ] **Implement retry logic** - Handle connection failures, timeouts
- [ ] **Create printer capability detection** - Detect supported languages, features

### 2. Code Sharing Improvements
- [ ] **Extract common enums** - Move Command, PrintFormat, etc. to shared model
- [ ] **Create platform-agnostic printer interface** - Abstract native differences
- [ ] **Implement shared error handling** - Unified error codes and messages
- [ ] **Create shared validation logic** - Validate ZPL/CPCL syntax, printer addresses
- [ ] **Implement shared logging** - Unified logging across platforms

### 3. API Improvements
- [ ] **Simplify public API** - Reduce complexity of method calls
- [ ] **Add printer capability queries** - Query supported languages, features
- [ ] **Implement printer status monitoring** - Real-time status updates
- [ ] **Add print job management** - Queue, cancel, status of print jobs
- [ ] **Create printer configuration management** - Save/load printer settings

## Medium Priority

### 4. Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Add unit tests for Dart logic** - Test language detection, validation
- [ ] **Add integration tests** - Test full print workflow
- [ ] **Add platform-specific tests** - Test iOS/Android specific features
- [ ] **Implement automated testing** - CI/CD pipeline with device testing
- [ ] **Add error simulation** - Test error handling paths

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] **Create API documentation** - Comprehensive API reference
- [ ] **Add code examples** - More real-world usage examples
- [ ] **Create troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Add performance guidelines** - Best practices for production use
- [ ] **Create migration guide** - From old API to new API

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Optimize discovery performance** - Faster printer discovery
- [ ] **Implement connection pooling** - Reuse connections when possible
- [ ] **Add print job batching** - Batch multiple print jobs
- [ ] **Optimize memory usage** - Reduce memory footprint
- [ ] **Implement async operations** - Non-blocking print operations

## Low Priority

### 7. Advanced Features
- [ ] **Add printer firmware updates** - Update printer firmware
- [ ] **Implement printer diagnostics** - Self-test, status reporting
- [ ] **Add print job history** - Track print jobs over time
- [ ] **Create printer templates** - Save/load print templates
- [ ] **Add printer grouping** - Manage multiple printers

### 8. Platform Enhancements
- [ ] **Add macOS support** - Desktop printing support
- [ ] **Add Windows support** - Windows printing support
- [ ] **Add Linux support** - Linux printing support
- [ ] **Add web support** - Web-based printing (if possible)

### 9. Developer Experience
- [ ] **Create Flutter Inspector integration** - Debug printer connections
- [ ] **Add hot reload support** - Update printer logic without restart
- [ ] **Create development tools** - Printer testing utilities
- [ ] **Add logging integration** - Integration with logging frameworks
- [ ] **Create code generation** - Generate printer code from templates

## Technical Debt

### 10. Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove deprecated APIs** - Clean up old method signatures
- [ ] **Standardize error handling** - Consistent error patterns
- [ ] **Improve type safety** - Better type definitions
- [ ] **Add null safety** - Complete null safety implementation
- [ ] **Refactor large methods** - Break down complex methods

### 11. Dependencies
- [ ] **Update ZSDK versions** - Keep up with latest Zebra SDK
- [ ] **Minimize dependencies** - Reduce plugin dependencies
- [ ] **Update Flutter SDK** - Support latest Flutter versions
- [ ] **Add dependency health checks** - Monitor dependency status
- [ ] **Create dependency update automation** - Auto-update dependencies

## Notes
- Focus on moving business logic to Dart for better code sharing
- Keep native code minimal and focused on platform-specific bridging
- Prioritize stability and reliability over new features
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- Document all changes thoroughly for maintainability
