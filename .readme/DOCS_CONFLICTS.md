# Documentation Conflicts and Ambiguities

This document tracks unresolved conflicts and ambiguities found during documentation reorganization.

## Resolved Conflicts ✅

### 1. iOS Setup Instructions Duplication
**Conflict**: Info.plist configuration appeared twice in `.readme/ios/README.md`
**Resolution**: Merged into single comprehensive setup section in `platforms/ios/setup.md`

### 2. CPCL Implementation Details
**Conflict**: CPCL examples scattered across multiple files
**Resolution**: Consolidated into `guides/printing-formats.md`

### 3. Documentation Structure
**Conflict**: No clear hierarchy or organization
**Resolution**: Created logical structure with api/, platforms/, guides/, development/

## Unresolved Ambiguities

None - all major ambiguities have been resolved.

## Documentation Gaps

### 1. Error Handling
- ✅ Basic error codes documented in API reference
- ✅ Comprehensive error code reference created
- ✅ Result pattern documented with examples
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling patterns between platforms (Android needs update)

### 2. Performance Guidelines
- ✅ Basic timeout guidance in API reference
- ✅ Print data size limits documented
- ✅ Connection pooling examples provided
- ✅ Performance optimization guide created

### 3. Testing
- Testing guide exists but lacks:
  - ❌ Unit test examples
  - ❌ Integration test setup
  - ❌ Mock printer setup

## Summary

### ✅ Resolved During Reorganization
- **Android Implementation Status**: Now clearly documented in `platforms/android/README.md`
- **Thread Safety Claims**: Now properly documented in iOS platform docs
- **Documentation Structure**: Created clear hierarchy and organization
- **iOS Setup Duplication**: Merged into single comprehensive guide
- **CPCL Examples**: Consolidated into printing formats guide

### ✅ Resolved in This Update
- **Version Numbering**: Standardized to 0.1.0 with auto-increment strategy
- **Auto-Detection**: Documented current implementation
- **Error Handling**: Created Result pattern and comprehensive error codes
- **Performance Guidelines**: Added complete performance guide

### ❌ Still Need Resolution
- **Platform Consistency**: Android needs Result pattern implementation
- **Testing**: Add unit tests, integration tests, and mock setup
