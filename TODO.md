# Comprehensive Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Issues Identified
1. Missing mocks for ZebraPrinter methods (isPrinterConnected, getSetting)
2. Several files have 0% coverage
3. Many command classes are not tested
4. Major components have no coverage

## Test Coverage Analysis
Based on lcov.info analysis:
- Files with 0% coverage (LH:0): 15+ files
- Files with low coverage: Multiple command classes
- Major untested components: ZebraPrinterManager, SmartPrintManager, ZebraPrinterReadinessManager

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Fix Missing Mocks (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Update ZebraPrinter mock to include all methods
- [ ] Add missing mocks for isPrinterConnected, getSetting
- [ ] Fix existing test failures due to missing stubs

### 2. Add Tests for Untested Command Classes (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] check_connection_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_head_status_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_host_status_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_language_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_pause_status_command.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] send_calibration_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] send_unpause_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_printer_status_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] get_detailed_printer_status_command_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] send_command_command_test.dart (low coverage)

### 3. Add Tests for Major Components (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] zebra_printer_manager_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] smart_print_manager_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] zebra_printer_readiness_manager_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] zebra_printer_discovery_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] zebra_test.dart (0% coverage)

### 4. Add Tests for Model Classes (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] communication_policy_event_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] operation_log_entry_test.dart (low coverage)
- [ ] print_event_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] print_options_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] readiness_operation_event_test.dart (0% coverage)
- [ ] readiness_options_test.dart (low coverage)
- [ ] readiness_result_test.dart (0% coverage)

### 5. Add Tests for Internal Components (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] communication_policy_test.dart (low coverage)
- [ ] operation_manager_test.dart (low coverage)
- [ ] permission_manager_test.dart (low coverage)
- [ ] printer_preferences_test.dart (low coverage)

### 6. Improve Existing Tests (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Enhance existing command tests with more scenarios
- [ ] Add edge case testing
- [ ] Improve error handling test coverage

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with fixing mocks to resolve current test failures
2. Add tests for command classes (smaller, focused tests)
3. Add tests for major components (more complex, integration-style)
4. Add tests for model classes (simple unit tests)
5. Improve existing tests with additional scenarios

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with no failures
- Coverage > 80% for all files
- No files with 0% coverage
- All public APIs have test coverage
- Proper use of Mockito mocks throughout
